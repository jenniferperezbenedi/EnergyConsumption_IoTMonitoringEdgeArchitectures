# EnergyConsumption_IoTMonitoringEdgeArchitectures
This repository presents the experimental results of an exploratory study that measures the energy consumption of  four Edge software architecture configurations of an indoor environmental monitoring IoT system. This dataset provides the raw measurements, the data analysis and the results comparison of the four architectures.
This repository is composed of five folders. Their content is explainded following:
- AdditionalMetrics: It includes the raw data obtained from the 24 experiments that are not used for calculating the energy consumption but it was provided by the measurement tools.
- BasalEnergyConsumption: It includes the raw data of the experiments launched to measure the basal consumption of the Smart Gateway. In addition, the excel file with the calculation of the Basal Energy Consumption is also provided.
- DataSynthesis: The data analysis and synthesis from the results of energy consumption are included in this folder. 
- EnergyMeasurementExperiments: It includes the raw energy consumption data obtained from the 24 experiments.
- Figures: It includes the figures generated from the data obtained.
